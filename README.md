# Haskell Project Euler

[SPOILER ALERT]

This repository contains the answers to some of the early Project Euler
problems. Do not look at these solutions if you wish to solve the problems 
yourself.

This repository is an Etude in Haskell, giving me an opportunity to learn
an interesting language while solving fun math problems.
